Help shape the future of patient-centered cancer care.

Dear Friend,

In 2006, we created the LIVESTRONG Survey so that we could learn from cancer survivors about their cancer experience and how to better meet their emotional, practical and physical needs.

Through the years, the surveys have helped us develop life-changing programs focused on providing the best in patient-centered cancer care. Here are a few examples:

* After cancer survivors told us that they were experiencing fatigue and were unsure how to exercise after treatment, LIVESTRONG at the YMCA was created to help them regain strength and energy. http://www.livestrong.org/what-we-do/our-actions/programs-partnerships/livestrong-at-the-ymca/

* We discovered that many cancer survivors were experiencing long-term issues with their emotional health after cancer, so we developed the Community Impact Project to bring emotional support programs to cities around the country.

* Informed by the practical needs cancer survivors told us they faced, we developed the LIVESTRONG Guidebook, our two-volume resource guide on how to navigate your way through the cancer journey.

With just ten minutes of your time, help us continue to improve the daily lives of cancer survivors by taking "Information Needs and Resources," the first of the 2014 LIVESTRONG Surveys.
